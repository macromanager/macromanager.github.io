                        VBA is great for solving problems with automation and is especially valuable when macros are developed for reusability. MacroManager extends the value of your macros by providing a platform for storing and distributing reusable code. Packages are installed into an open Excel workbook by using the MacroManager desktop application. This tutorial will demonstrate how to install packages by using the “Hello, World.” package as an example. Once the package is installed you can use the macros like any other VBA code in your workbook.

                                Begin by opening the MacroManager desktop application. Use the search bar to find the package from the collection. Select the package to display its details and install. Confirm that the contents of the package were installed successfully, by opening up the VBA editor. There should be a new code module with the a subroutine called HelloWorld. Run the function to see the hello world popup.
